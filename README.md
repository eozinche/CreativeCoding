CreativeCoding
==============

Professional Development for ITPers that want to be creative coders.  Taught with Cinder and C++, but many of the concepts apply to all programming languages.

Code will be in the repo and links to videos can be found in the readme's. For Cinder specific projects, those with a folder structure similar to 

- assets
- include
- resources
- src
- xcode

will need to point to cinder on your disk. If you open up the xcode project, click on the project name on the top left. That will open up project settings. Click on the Build Settings tag in the middle and scroll to the bottom and for the "User-Defined Variables", change the definition of CINDER_PATH to the relative path of cinder to the xcode folder.
